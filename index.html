	<p>Click the file dialog below and select your ATT or MM data files. By default, they are located in %userprofile%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\SavedVariables.</p>
	<p>You can upload multiple files at once, but can't upload MM and ATT files at the same time.</p>
	<p>Only upload files called either ArkadiusTradeToolsSalesDataXX.lua or MMXXData.lua, where XX is replaced by digits.</p>
	<p>They will be converted to CSV which can be viewed in Excel or similar software.</p>
	<p>These files are not uploaded to the server, they remain on your computer and are processed inside the browser.</p>
